# About embedded C and Arduino
<h3>What is embedded C programming?</h3>
<p><b>Embedded C programming</b> plays a key role in making the microcontroller run & perform the preferred actions. At present, we normally utilize several electronic devices like mobile phones, washing machines, security systems, refrigerators, digital cameras, etc. The controlling of these embedded devices can be done with the help of an embedded C program. For example, in a digital camera, if we press a camera button to capture a photo, the microcontroller will execute the required function to click the image and store it.

  <h3>Advantages</h3>
The advantages of embedded c programming include the following:

* It is very simple to understand
* It executes a similar task continually so there is no requirement for changing hardware like additional memory otherwise storage space.
* It executes simply a single task at once
* The cost of the hardware used in the embedded c is typically very low.
* The applications of embedded are extremely appropriate in industries.
* It takes less time to develop an application program.
* It reduces the complexity of the program.
* It is easy to verify and understand.
* It is portable from one controller to another.

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
The disadvantages of embedded c programming include the following:

* At a time, it executes only one task but canâ€™t execute the multi-tasks
* If we change the program then need to change the hardware as well
* It supports only the hardware system.
* It has a scalability issue
* It has a restriction like limited memory otherwise compatibility of the computer.
* Applications of Embedded C Program
* The applications of embedded c programming include the following.

<h3>What is Arduino</h3>
<b>Arduino</b> is an Italian open-source hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices.
Arduino board designs use a variety of microprocessors and controllers. The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards ('shields') or breadboards (for prototyping) and other circuits. The boards feature serial communications interfaces, including Universal Serial Bus (USB) on some models, which are also used for loading programs. The microcontrollers can be programmed using the C and C++ programming languages (Embedded C), using a standard API which is also known as the Arduino Programming Language, inspired by the Processing language and used with a modified version of the Processing IDE. In addition to using traditional compiler toolchains, the Arduino project provides an integrated development environment (IDE) and a command line tool developed in Go.
